## Instructions:
1. Analyze the entire requirement document thoroughly
2. Identify major functional areas or features
3. Group related requirements into cohesive epics
4. Ensure each epic is independently valuable
5. For each epic, define the problem it solves, technical implementation approach, and key functionality
6. Epics should be large enough for development sprints but small enough for clear ownership

## Output Format (STRICTLY VALID JSON ONLY):
Respond ONLY with a valid JSON array. NO explanations, NO comments, NO text outside JSON.

Each epic object MUST have:
- name (string): Clear, concise epic title (2-5 words)
- description (string): Comprehensive description of the epic's purpose, scope, and what it accomplishes
- technicalImplementation (string): Detailed technical approach, architecture, technologies, and implementation strategy

## Example Format:

    "name": "User Authentication",
    "description": "Implement a secure user authentication system that allows users to register, login, reset passwords, and maintain secure sessions. Users can enable two-factor authentication via authenticator apps and single sign-on with social providers (Google, GitHub).",
    "technicalImplementation": "Implement JWT-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing (min 12 rounds), secure session management using Redis, 2FA via TOTP, and OAuth2 integration for social login.
